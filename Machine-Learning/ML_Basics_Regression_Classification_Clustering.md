# üìö Machine Learning Core Concepts: Regression, Classification, Clustering

---

# 1. Regression

**Goal:**  
Predict a **continuous value** (something that can have any real number value).

### üìå Real-world Examples:
- Predict house prices based on size, location, etc. (e.g., ‚Çπ25.6 lakhs)
- Predict tomorrow's temperature (e.g., 32.5¬∞C)
- Predict sales of a product next month

### üéØ How it works:
You give features ‚Üí Model learns ‚Üí Model predicts a continuous number.

| Feature | Output |
|:-------|:------|
| House size = 1000 sqft | ‚Çπ50 lakhs |
| House size = 1500 sqft | ‚Çπ75 lakhs |

The model finds a **line** or **curve** that best fits this relationship.

### üìà Visual Intuition:
Imagine plotting points on a graph, the model tries to draw a line/curve that passes as close as possible through these points.

### üõ†Ô∏è Algorithms used:
- Linear Regression
- Polynomial Regression
- Decision Tree Regression
- Random Forest Regression
- Support Vector Regression (SVR)

### üß† Simple Example (Python):
```python
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
import numpy as np

X = np.array([[1000], [1500], [2000], [2500]])  # size
y = np.array([50, 75, 100, 125])  # price in lakhs

model = LinearRegression()
model.fit(X, y)

print(model.predict([[1800]]))  # Output: around 90 lakhs
```

---

# 2. Classification

**Goal:**  
Predict a **category** or **label** (discrete output).

### üìå Real-world Examples:
- Email Spam or Not Spam (Yes/No)
- Predict disease: Positive or Negative
- Recognizing digits from images (0-9)

### üéØ How it works:
You give features ‚Üí Model learns ‚Üí Model predicts one of the predefined classes.

| Features | Output |
|:--------|:------|
| Fever = Yes, Cough = Yes, Travel History = Yes | COVID Positive |
| Fever = No, Cough = Yes, Travel History = No | COVID Negative |

### üìà Visual Intuition:
Imagine points plotted on a graph. The model draws a boundary separating different categories.

### üõ†Ô∏è Algorithms used:
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Trees
- Random Forest
- Support Vector Machines (SVM)
- k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN)
- Neural Networks

### üß† Simple Example (Python):
```python
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
import numpy as np

X = np.array([[1, 1], [1, 0], [0, 1], [0, 0]])
y = np.array([1, 0, 0, 0])

model = LogisticRegression()
model.fit(X, y)

print(model.predict([[1, 1]]))  # Output: [1] -> COVID Positive
```
##A possible output of above sample can be '0' also. A discussion is below :-

# Why Logistic Regression Predicted '0' Instead of '1' and How `class_weight='balanced'` Fixed It

## Problem Summary

We trained a `LogisticRegression` model with this small dataset:

| Feature 1 | Feature 2 | Label |
|:---------:|:---------:|:-----:|
|     1     |     1     |   1   |
|     1     |     0     |   0   |
|     0     |     1     |   0   |
|     0     |     0     |   0   |

Expected output: `1` (COVID Positive)

Actual output: `0`

---

## Why Was the Output '0'?

- **Class Imbalance:**
  - 3 samples with label `0`, only 1 sample with label `1`.
  - Logistic Regression tries to minimize error. Predicting `0` most of the time is safer.

- **Regularization:**
  - By default, `LogisticRegression` uses `penalty='l2'` and `C=1.0`.
  - This penalizes large weights, leading to simpler decision boundaries favoring the majority class (`0`).

- **Threshold for Classification:**
  - Logistic Regression predicts based on probability.
  - If probability of `1` is less than `0.5`, it predicts `0`.

Thus, even for input `[1, 1]`, the model ended up predicting `0`.

---

## How `class_weight='balanced'` Fixed It

Code after modification:
```python - we can replace below in original code
model = LogisticRegression(class_weight='balanced')
model.fit(X, y)

print(model.predict([[1, 1]]))
```

- **Automatic Weight Adjustment:**
  - `class_weight='balanced'` sets class weights inversely proportional to their frequencies.
  - Minority class (`1`) gets more importance during training.

- **Effect on Model:**
  - Misclassifying a `1` incurs a heavier penalty.
  - The model adjusts its decision boundary to favor correct predictions for the minority class.

- **Outcome:**
  - Now for input `[1, 1]`, the model correctly predicts `1`.

---

## Key Takeaways

- **Always be careful with class imbalance**, especially in small datasets.
- **Use `class_weight='balanced'`** when imbalance is present.
- **Monitor prediction probabilities** (`predict_proba`) if results seem counter-intuitive.
- **Tune regularization (`C` value)** if needed to adjust model complexity.

---

This small tweak helped the model respect minority class samples and corrected the prediction behavior!

# 3. Clustering

**Goal:**  
**Group** similar things **together** without knowing the labels beforehand.  
(**Unsupervised Learning**)

### üìå Real-world Examples:
- Grouping customers based on shopping behavior
- Identifying different species of flowers automatically
- Detecting fraudulent transactions

### üéØ How it works:
You give features ‚Üí Model finds "clusters" or "groups" that naturally exist in the data.

### üìà Visual Intuition:
Points form natural "clouds" in the graph. Clustering groups each "cloud" separately.

### üõ†Ô∏è Algorithms used:
- K-Means Clustering
- DBSCAN
- Hierarchical Clustering
- Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM)

### üß† Simple Example (Python):
```python
from sklearn.cluster import KMeans
import numpy as np

X = np.array([[25, 50000], [27, 52000], [45, 90000], [46, 92000], [70, 60000]])

kmeans = KMeans(n_clusters=2)
kmeans.fit(X)

print(kmeans.labels_)  # Output: [0 0 1 1 1]
```
