# 📚 Machine Learning Core Concepts: Regression, Classification, Clustering

---

# 1. Regression

**Goal:**  
Predict a **continuous value** (something that can have any real number value).

### 📌 Real-world Examples:
- Predict house prices based on size, location, etc. (e.g., ₹25.6 lakhs)
- Predict tomorrow's temperature (e.g., 32.5°C)
- Predict sales of a product next month

### 🎯 How it works:
You give features → Model learns → Model predicts a continuous number.

| Feature | Output |
|:-------|:------|
| House size = 1000 sqft | ₹50 lakhs |
| House size = 1500 sqft | ₹75 lakhs |

The model finds a **line** or **curve** that best fits this relationship.

### 📈 Visual Intuition:
Imagine plotting points on a graph, the model tries to draw a line/curve that passes as close as possible through these points.

### 🛠️ Algorithms used:
- Linear Regression
- Polynomial Regression
- Decision Tree Regression
- Random Forest Regression
- Support Vector Regression (SVR)

### 🧠 Simple Example (Python):
```python
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
import numpy as np

X = np.array([[1000], [1500], [2000], [2500]])  # size
y = np.array([50, 75, 100, 125])  # price in lakhs

model = LinearRegression()
model.fit(X, y)

print(model.predict([[1800]]))  # Output: around 90 lakhs
```

# 2. Classification

**Goal:**  
Predict a **category** or **label** (discrete output).

### 📌 Real-world Examples:
- Email Spam or Not Spam (Yes/No)
- Predict disease: Positive or Negative
- Recognizing digits from images (0-9)

### 🎯 How it works:
You give features → Model learns → Model predicts one of the predefined classes.

| Features | Output |
|:--------|:------|
| Fever = Yes, Cough = Yes, Travel History = Yes | COVID Positive |
| Fever = No, Cough = Yes, Travel History = No | COVID Negative |

### 📈 Visual Intuition:
Imagine points plotted on a graph. The model draws a boundary separating different categories.

### 🛠️ Algorithms used:
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Trees
- Random Forest
- Support Vector Machines (SVM)
- k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN)
- Neural Networks

### 🧠 Simple Example (Python):
```python
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
import numpy as np

X = np.array([[1, 1], [1, 0], [0, 1], [0, 0]])
y = np.array([1, 0, 0, 0])

model = LogisticRegression()
model.fit(X, y)

print(model.predict([[1, 1]]))  # Output: [1] -> COVID Positive
```

# 3. Clustering

**Goal:**  
**Group** similar things **together** without knowing the labels beforehand.  
(**Unsupervised Learning**)

### 📌 Real-world Examples:
- Grouping customers based on shopping behavior
- Identifying different species of flowers automatically
- Detecting fraudulent transactions

### 🎯 How it works:
You give features → Model finds "clusters" or "groups" that naturally exist in the data.

### 📈 Visual Intuition:
Points form natural "clouds" in the graph. Clustering groups each "cloud" separately.

### 🛠️ Algorithms used:
- K-Means Clustering
- DBSCAN
- Hierarchical Clustering
- Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM)

### 🧠 Simple Example (Python):
```python
from sklearn.cluster import KMeans
import numpy as np

X = np.array([[25, 50000], [27, 52000], [45, 90000], [46, 92000], [70, 60000]])

kmeans = KMeans(n_clusters=2)
kmeans.fit(X)

print(kmeans.labels_)  # Output: [0 0 1 1 1]
```

# 🔥 Pro Tip:
- Regression & Classification = **Supervised Learning** (needs labels)
- Clustering = **Unsupervised Learning** (no labels)
